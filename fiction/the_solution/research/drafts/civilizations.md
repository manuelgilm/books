# Civilizations

In this solar system, there are at least three known civilizations, the mechas, the liberals, and the conservatives. Let's describe at a high level each one of these cultures.

## The mechas.

This culture is far more interesting than the other civilizations taking place in this solar system. A book will be dedicated to this culture, however, in this section, some high levels descriptions will be provided.

The mechas are the oldest civilization in this solar system, therefore the evolutive process, which is common among all the species, have had far more time to develop this civilization. They are a technological civilization, everything is based on science, they stopped all natural evolutive process by replacing part of their bodies with mechanical substitutes, by the time the story happens the distinction between a biological being and a robot is subtle.

### The evolutive process.

Usually, the birth of a new species is more or less a random process, everything starts with a simple life form, some mutations take place inside the cells of this basic life form and external factors encourage the proliferation of some of them and the dissapeareance the others, this process, which is known as natural selection, leads to the emergence of new species that are completely adapted to their environment.

As mentioned above, evolution is a random process with a sense of direction, and we can be sure that in the vast majority of cases the direction is provided by the environment, however, there are cases in which the process does not follow this, for example, on earth, humans are able to create completely new species from other species altering two factors mainly, the environment and the offspring, we call this process artificial selection. Many domestic animals, farm animals, and even numerous crops were brought about in this manner.

The emergence of life still holds many mysteries, sometimes life can bring about in unexpected ways, and this is the case of *the mechas*.

### Humankind and the Mechas

Mutations are changes in genetic material of life forms, there are many factors that can lead to a mutation, they are relatively often but in the vast majority of the cases, these changes are irrelevant and do not represent any alteration in the phenotype of the species. However, there are cases in which, by sheer chance, a mutation can lead to a completely new species.

## The Menderose:

This is a conservative culture, they have strict norms about
