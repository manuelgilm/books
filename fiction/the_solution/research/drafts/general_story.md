# General idea.

The story takes place in a distant feature, on a remote solar system, in which we can find different planets harboring different civilizations. 

Each planet has a particular history therefore the dominant species has developed a particular culture, as time goes by, each one of the civilizations develops technology, that allows them to travel in the vicinity of the solar system, so these cultures start to interact with each other and for a long time everything is peaceful and harmonious.

The peace looked eternal, there were no problems or profound conflicts among each one of the cultures, however, some differences in religion brought about some conflicts between them. 

## The protagonist 

There is a civilization on a more remote planet, this planet can be found inside the same solar system, however, the main species of this planet is quite different from the rest of the cultures in that particular solar system. 

This species seems to be far more advanced than the rest of the cultures, their technology is much more advanced and they left behind their biological past, even though they still have to satisfy some biological needs, they are basically machines, they use logic and rational thinking to address all problems. (we can call them *the mechas*)

## The travel

The mechas observe the rest of the solar system in complete devastation,  and they want to solve that problem because the war between the rest of the cultures may lead to the destruction of the star, and since the mechas use as a main source of energy the sun (we need to find a name for this star) this conflict is their main concern.
