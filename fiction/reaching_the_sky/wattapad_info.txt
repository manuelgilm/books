title: Escape Plan: A Journey to Freedom. 
description: 
Jakl is a man living in a society that restricts personal freedom,
 and he dreams of escaping to a neighboring planet where he can live 
 a free life. He finally takes matters into his own hands and sneaks 
 onto a cargo chamber carrying animals to the neighboring planet, 
 hiding in a compartment meant for animal food. With a long journey 
 ahead of him, he must survive on limited supplies and avoid being 
 caught by authorities. Already orbiting the new planet,
  he looks at this and is amazed by the advanced technology and 
  the bustling activity of space travel as he looks out at the scene of 
  hundreds of space elevators rising from the surface of the planet, 
  resembling a dandelion.
