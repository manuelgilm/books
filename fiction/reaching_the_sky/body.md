# A glimmer of hope

It was a boring night, nothing was out of normal. The machinery that propels the space elevator was the only thing that could be heard. From time to time a transport chamber arrived at or departed from the station, and these devices generated a particular sound, when the chamber arrived, a sound similar to the sound a steam engine would make was heard first. Then when the chamber hits the platform, a somewhat loud, deep sound was heard. 

Even though these events broke the tranquility of the night, it was nothing compared to the turmoil generated by the operation of the space elevator back in the past. They were better times for space commerce, now these operations were at the minimum required. The number of people the station required in the past was around a hundred. Now, a typical day's operation required only a handful of people, working in different parts of the station.

Some of the workers at the station worked completely alone, spending all hours without any interaction, with others. There were many restrictions on that planet and even though smoking was completely prohibited, he was there, looking at the figures produced by his cigarette, assigning names and familiar shapes to the small forms rising from the cigarette until they completely disappeared. He was complaining about the limitations of a body, he thought that if he was like gas or like smoke, he could easily escape from that confinement that others called working place.

A few minutes went by and the sensation of the cigarette in his mouth was now only in his memory. Fortunately, he thought, the chemicals he just absorbed are now in the brain, they will help to get by the rest of the working hours. The task he had to accomplish was not complicated at all. He needed to check the chambers and ensure that all the merchandise specified in the transportation report was there. Having access to these chambers before anyone else allowed him to receive and put smuggling. This was the way he obtained cigarettes and the punishment for doing this was death, however, for him life was little more than a burden that he had to carry on his back. From this perspective, cigarettes were completely worth it.

After a few hours, the tediousness of work was unbearable, and all of the sudden, a thought, an idea came to his mind. What would happen if he just got into one of the chambers and escape, he knew very well that all the products were destined for the neighboring planet. He thought, once there he could rebuild his life. without any of the absurd limitations that the leaders of his native planet imposed, life was beginning to make sense.

# Planning the Escape

It was already the end of the shift when a robotic voice came over his intercom.

> Voice: "Unit number 92 Jakl Howerl, leave the complex using gate number 7" 

Jakl tidied up his workstation, making sure there were no detectable cigarette remnants. And headed for the designated exit. This was probably the first time he experimented with a real desire to get to his room as quickly as possible. He had a lot to think about, and the more he did so, the more his plan seemed more like a dream than something feasible.

The sun was already fully visible in the sky, it was a cloudy day, and many would say that it was a perfect day to be out. However, since Jakl was working the night shift this was irrelevant to him, once in his room, he took a bath and prepared everything to go to bed. There was not too much to be done, his ritual consisted of making sure the sleep gas generator was on, this was a device that created an artificial atmosphere filled with somniferous gas. It was completely automatic, this device would turn off after some minutes of operation. The room did not have a window so the sunlight was not able to reach any corner of it. Finally, fatigue did the final work, and after a few minutes, it would have been impossible to determine whether this was a living creature or a corpse.

After several hours, Jakl was awake, with more doubts than certainties, he started to devise a plan to escape using the spacial elevator, but this was not easy. The chambers he had access to were not designed to transport crew, the space was limited and the journey was dangerous. His idea was basically to reach the spacecraft that was in orbit. Once there it was a one-week trip from the outer atmosphere to the neighboring planet. He knew these vessels were completely automated, and they were meant to transport only merchandise, meaning that once inside one of them the only he had to do was to wait for the completion of the travel. There were two very obvious problems.

Before leaving the planet, each one of the chambers had to pass through a second inspection module. This was a routine inspection that in most instances, it involved analyzing the chamber with a laser to look for anomalies. The second problem was the travel itself, the conditions to which it would be exposed once it was out of the atmosphere. The section he had access to were not designed to support life, once the chamber is out of the atmosphere there would not be oxygen to breathe, and the temperature would have been too low. He was trapped.


From time to time workers at the space elevator had to change the sector in which they were working. Jakl thought about this that it was a good way to dispel the boredom that usually afflicted him when he kept working in the same sector for too long. The downside of this is that he could not obtain contraband merchandise in all sectors.

# The Chamber 

A few days had passed since the idea of escaping from the planet had arisen, and by that time it was a bit more than just a fantasy, an infatuation that sometimes distracted him from the boredom of his job. It was too difficult he thought while staring at the emptiness. Then, a strange noise awoke him from his thought.

It was one of the chambers that had just arrived on the platform, but in this case, the sound coming from this one was something a little different from what he was used to. The chamber was slightly larger, and the coating seemed more reinforced than usual. He hurried to take the report indicating the type of items the chamber was carrying. Surprisingly, the chamber was empty. After scrutinizing the documents related to that particular chamber, he realized that this was a special chamber designed to transport animals. He was surprised, and frustrated with himself at the same time, after all, it was his job to know this information.

Although commerce with the neighboring planet was declining, there was a relatively constant flow of goods between the two planets. In this particular case, the neighboring planet was ordering several hundred camels. Even though this animal was known for its suitability for desert climates, it was also quite popular for the taste of its meat, and inhabitants from the neighboring planet knew this very well, the order was to satisfy the exquisite palates of the inhabitants of the other planet.

Soon after knowing this information, a thought came to Jakl's mind, startling him in the same way that lightning surprises people in the darkest of storms. If the chamber was able to transport living animals there should not be problems transporting him. His heart began to beat faster than normal. Images of him living somewhere other than the dictatorship in which he lived began to flood into his head.
