## Escape Plan: A Journey to Freedom. 

# A glimmer of hope

It was a boring night, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The only sound that could be heard was the machinery that propelled the space elevator. From time to time, a transport chamber would arrive at or depart from the station, generating a distinct sound. When a chamber arrived, it emitted a sound similar to that of a steam engine, and when it hit the platform, a deep, loud noise followed.

Although these events disrupted the tranquility of the night, they paled in comparison to the turmoil generated by the space elevator's operations in the past. Those were better times for space commerce; nowadays, these operations only run at a minimum level. In the past, the station required around a hundred people to operate, whereas now, only a handful of people are needed for a typical day's operation, and they work in different parts of the station.

Some workers at the station spent their hours in complete isolation, with no interaction with others. Despite strict restrictions on the planet, including a complete smoking ban, one worker smoked and watched the figures produced by his cigarette, assigning names and familiar shapes to the small forms rising from it until they disappeared. He complained about the limitations of the body and wished he were like gas or smoke, able to easily escape from the confinement that others called the workplace.

After a few minutes, the sensation of the cigarette in his mouth was just a memory. But he was grateful that the chemicals he had just absorbed were now in his brain, helping him to get through the remaining hours of work. The task was straightforward: check the transport chambers and ensure that all the specified merchandise was there. As someone with access to these chambers before anyone else, he could receive and put smuggling. Obtaining cigarettes this way was risky, as the punishment for smuggling was death, but life was a burden to him. From his perspective, cigarettes were worth the risk.


After hours of tedious work, the burden became unbearable, and suddenly an idea flashed through his mind. What if he got into one of the chambers and escaped? He knew that all the products were destined for a neighboring planet, and once there, he could start a new one without the absurd limitations that his native planet's leaders had imposed. Life was beginning to make sense again.

# Planning the Escape

As Jakl's shift was coming to an end, a robotic voice suddenly spoke through his intercom.

| Voice: "Unit number 92 Jakl Howerl, leave the complex using gate number 7."

Jakl quickly tidied up his workstation, making sure there were no detectable cigarette remnants, and headed towards the designated exit. This was probably the first time he had a real desire to get back to his room as quickly as possible. He had a lot to think about, and the more he thought, the more his plan seemed like a dream rather than something feasible.

The sun was fully visible in the sky, even though it was a cloudy day. For most people, it would have been the perfect day to be outside. However, since Jakl was working the night shift, the weather was irrelevant to him. Once he arrived in his room, he took a bath and prepared for bed. There wasn't much to do - his ritual consisted of making sure the sleep gas generator was on. This device created an artificial atmosphere filled with a somniferous gas and would automatically turn off after several minutes. Since his room had no windows, sunlight couldn't reach any corner of it. Finally, fatigue took over, and after a few minutes, it would have been impossible to tell whether Jakl was a living creature or a corpse.

Several hours later, Jakl awoke with more doubts than certainties. He began devising a plan to escape using the space elevator, but he knew it wouldn't be easy. The transport chambers he had access to were not designed to carry crew, and the journey would be dangerous and cramped. His idea was to reach the spacecraft that orbited the planet. Once there, it would be a one-week trip from the outer atmosphere to the neighboring planet. These vessels were completely automated and meant to transport only merchandise, so once he was inside, he would only need to wait for the trip to be completed. However, there were two obvious problems.

Before leaving the planet, each one of the chambers had to pass through a second inspection module, which involved analyzing the chamber with a laser to look for anomalies. However, this routine inspection posed a problem for Jakl's plan. The second problem was the conditions to which he would be exposed during the travel once the chamber was out of the atmosphere. The section he had access to was not designed to support life. There would be no oxygen to breathe, and the temperature would be too low. Therefore, he felt trapped.

From time to time workers at the space elevator had to change the sector in which they were working. Jakl considered this to be a good way to alleviate the boredom that often plagued him when he worked in the same sector for an extended period. The downside of this is that he could not obtain contraband merchandise in all sectors.

# The Chamber 

Several days had passed since Jakl's idea of escaping the planet first emerged, and it had evolved beyond mere fantasy. It was now a persistent infatuation that sometimes distracted him from the boredom of his job. He often stared at the emptiness, thinking how difficult it would be to carry out such a daring plan. Suddenly, a strange noise shook him from his thoughts.

It was one of the chambers that had just arrived on the platform, but in this case, the sound coming from this one was something a little different from what he was used to. The chamber was slightly larger, and the coating seemed more reinforced than usual. He hurried to take the report indicating the type of items the chamber was carrying. Surprisingly, the chamber was empty. After scrutinizing the documents related to that particular chamber. He was surprised and frustrated with himself for not knowing that the chamber was a special one designed for transporting animals, which he should have been aware of given his job.

Despite the declining commerce with the neighboring planet, there remained a constant flow of goods, including a recent order for several hundred Merql. While these animals were known for their suitability for desert climates, they were also highly valued for their meat, which was a popular delicacy on the neighboring planet. The order had been placed to satisfy the exquisite palates of its inhabitants.

Soon after knowing this information, a thought came to Jakl's mind, startling him in the same way that lightning surprises people in the darkest of storms. If the chamber was able to transport living animals there should not be problems transporting him. His heart began to beat faster than normal. Images of him living somewhere other than the dictatorship in which he lived began to flood into his head.

There was not much time for Jakl to think or plan; the window of opportunity was only a few days. He knew he needed to act soon, or he would miss his chance to escape. However, he faced a new problem. This type of cargo was different from others. These animals needed supervision and someone to guide them to the chamber. The system assigned a different worker to take the animals from the cowshed to the chamber to ensure their correct transportation.

The problem was that the worker assigned to transport the animals was also responsible for inspecting the chamber and ensuring that no other living creatures besides Merqls were inside before closing it. If any other living creature was found, the alarms would sound and the departure of the chamber would be impeded. Initially, Jakl considered convincing the worker to escape with him, but he realized it was not a good idea. Furthermore, the chamber was scheduled to depart during the day shift, which meant that someone else would be in charge of Jakl's usual tasks.

Despite the social unrest on the planet, there were still many followers of the regime, making it difficult to distinguish between those who were against the system and those who were not. Adding to the challenge, the transport chamber had limited space for only one person. Jakl pondered all possible scenarios that could lead to his freedom, realizing that it would not be an easy feat to accomplish.

# The day

It was still dark outside when Jakl decided to sneak into the chamber and hide in one of the compartments used to store the animal's food. Though an extremely risky idea, it was the only option that countless hours of pondering had brought to his mind. Jakl was not tall, and so could easily fit into the compartment. Additionally, the travel was not going to take too long, making the plan feasible.

The time had come for Jakl to make his move. He only had a few minutes to get from the section he was working into the section where the new chamber was set to depart from. For anyone else, the building might have seemed like a maze, but after years of working there, Jakl was intimately familiar with its complicated corridors. He knew almost instinctively where each aisle led, making it easy for him to navigate through the building.

After several minutes of moving quickly but without arousing suspicion, Jakl arrived at the chamber. He quickly entered some commands on the gate control panel, which he had previously stolen, and a series of sounds indicated that the system was verifying the password. Every second felt longer than the previous one, and the four or five seconds Jakl had to wait for the confirmation of the code seemed like an eternity. Finally, the gate opened, allowing him to enter the chamber and hide in one of the compartments used for storing animal food.

A few seconds after Jakl closed the compartment door, the worker responsible for loading the animals into the chamber arrived. He worked efficiently to ensure the Merqls were securely loaded, as they were known for their docile nature. The task was completed without incident, and the chamber was soon ready for departure to the neighboring planet.

# Arrival

After a few minutes of turbulence, the chamber was now in space. Jakl poked his head in to make sure he was alone. As He had planned, he was completely alone surrounded by a group of animals that were more concerned about the food they were chewing than the curious shape that came out of one of the food compartments. Now Jakl was relatively safe, he only needed to wait about one week to arrive at the neighboring planet. He was excited and nervous at the same time.

Jakl had brought enough food to last a week, just to avoid the pain of starving. He knew the chamber had a special system that provided water to the animals, so he wasn't worried about dehydration. Authorities on both planets had become aware of his presence in the chamber as soon as he left the food compartment, but in space, which is no man's land that didn't matter. The planet he was heading to was prepared for such events; finding people in the cargo of these chambers was a common occurrence. People who were found were treated well and supported to start a new life.

The moment of arrival had arrived, and a red light began flashing, indicating that the chamber was about to enter the planet's atmosphere. Jakl grabbed onto some supports that came into view, not because the turbulence was unbearable, but rather as a natural reaction. Space elevators were a common technology among the planets in that solar system, but the planet Jakl was from only had a few, while the new planet had hundreds of them. Jakl could see them through a small window that allowed him to observe the outside of the chamber. The view was spectacular. He could see how hundreds of space elevators rose from the surface of the planet like long threads, and hundreds of spaceships came and went. The scene resembled a dandelion.
