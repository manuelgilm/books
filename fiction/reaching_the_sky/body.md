## Escape Plan: A Journey to Freedom. 

# A glimmer of hope

***?place*** It was a boring night, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The only sound that could be heard was the humming of the space elevator's propelling machinery. 

From time to time, a transport chamber would arrive at or depart from the station, generating a distinct sound. When a chamber arrived, it emitted a high-pitched whine—similar to that of a steam engine. And, when it settled onto the platform, low sonorous thud followed. Although these events disrupted the absolute tranquility of the night, no one stirred. The noise paled in comparison to the turmoil generated by the ancient space elevator's operations. 

In the past, the station required around a hundred people to operate. Indeed, those were the better times of space commerce. Nowadays, these operations only run at the barest minimum, evident by the need for only a handful of people—who work in different parts of the station—for a typical day's operation. Some of the station's workforce spent their hours in complete isolation, with little to no communicative interaction of sorts. ***?place***

Despite strict restrictions on the planet—which included a complete ban on the act of smoking—a single dispirited workman smoked ***?place*** and watched as hazy figures emerged from the cigarette, assigning names and familiar shapes to the rising dancing forms until they dissipated into the ventilating ___(is the office room well-ventilated?)___ air. He grumbled at the limitations of the flesh and wished he were like gas or smoke, able to easily slither away from the confinement that others called the workplace.

After hours upon hours of tedious work, when the burden became unbearable, a sudden idea flashed through his mind.

What if he sneaked into one of the chambers and escaped? 

He knew well enough that all the products were destined for a neighboring planet, and—once he was there—he could start anew without the absurd limitations imposed by the leaders of the planet he was born in, raised, and had lived since. Life was beginning to make sense again.

# Planning the Escape

As Jakl's shift was coming to an end, a robotic voice suddenly spoke through his intercom. _(Where is his intercom placed? breast pocket? wristwatch? or a speaker that is in the ceiling of the office?)_

| The voice: "Unit numbered ninety-two Jakl Howerl may leave the complex by gate numbered seven."

Jakl quickly tidied up his workstation, making sure there were no detectable remnants of his disobedience, and headed towards the designated exit. This was, perhaps, one of the first times he have had a genuine desire to get back to his room as quickly as could. There is a lot to think about. The more he thought, the more his plan felt like a wishful dream rather than something feasible.

The doors opened to reveal the sun in its full glory in the sky, unaffected by the thick clouds. For most, it would have been the perfect day to find various excuses to soak up the warmth outside. However, Jakl paid no heed and made way. He was working the night shift, after all, the daytime weather was irrelevant to him. 

Upon having arrived in his ___(an adjective)___ room, he took a bath and prepared for slumber. There wasn't much to do — his ritual consisted of making sure the sleep gas generator was on. This device, as its name suggests, creates an artificial atmosphere filled with a somniferous gas and would turn off, automatically, after several minutes. The room had no windows, so the piercing sunlight couldn't reach any corner of it, allowing darkness its reign. Finally, fatigue took over, and after a few minutes, it would have been impossible to tell whether Jakl was a living creature or a corpse.

※※※ ___(This is usually used to indicate change of time/scene/narrator)___

Several hours later, Jakl awoke with more doubts than certainties. He knew it wouldn't be easy. Regardless, he began devising a plan to escape using the space elevator. The transport chambers, that he had access to, were not designed to carry crew. The journey would be dangerous and cramped. His objective was to reach the spacecraft that orbited the planet. Once there, it would be a one-week trip from the outer atmosphere to the neighboring planet. These vessels were meant to transport only merchandise and, hence, it was completely automated. Once he infiltrated one of these spacecraft, he would only need to twiddle his thumbs for the rest of the trip.

However, there were two obvious problems.

Before leaving the planet, each one of these chambers had to pass through a second inspection module, which utilizes a laser to scan the chamber for anomalies. This routine inspection posed the first problem for Jakl's plan.

The second problem was the conditions, which he would be exposed to, during the travel once the chamber was out of the atmosphere. The section he had access to was not designed to support life. There would be no supply of oxygen to breathe, and the temperature would be below the optimum level for survival. 

And with this, Jackl felt trapped.

From time to time, workers at the space elevator had to change the sector in which they were working. This gave Jakl some sense of relief. He considered this shift an opportune alleviation of the boredom that often plagued him when he worked in the same sector for an extended period of time. The downside of this shifting of sectors is that he could not obtain a collection of the various contraband merchandise in all sectors. ___(What was the purpose of this paragraph? Will the contraband aid Jakl in his escape? How will the change of sectors affect his plan?)___

# The Chamber 

Several days had passed since Jakl's idea of escaping the planet first emerged, and it had evolved beyond mere fantasy. It was now a persistent infatuation that sometimes distracted him from the boredom of his job. He often stared at the emptiness, thinking how difficult it would be to carry out such a daring plan. Suddenly, a strange noise shook him from his thoughts.

It was one of the chambers that had just arrived on the platform, but in this case, the sound coming from this one was something a little different from what he was used to. The chamber was slightly larger, and the coating seemed more reinforced than usual. He hurried to take the report indicating the type of items the chamber was carrying. Surprisingly, the chamber was empty. After scrutinizing the documents related to that particular chamber. He was surprised and frustrated with himself for not knowing that the chamber was a special one designed for transporting animals, which he should have been aware of given his job.

Despite the declining commerce with the neighboring planet, there remained a constant flow of goods, including a recent order for several hundred Merql. While these animals were known for their suitability for desert climates, they were also highly valued for their meat, which was a popular delicacy on the neighboring planet. The order had been placed to satisfy the exquisite palates of its inhabitants.

Soon after knowing this information, a thought came to Jakl's mind, startling him in the same way that lightning surprises people in the darkest of storms. If the chamber was able to transport living animals there should not be problems transporting him. His heart began to beat faster than normal. Images of him living somewhere other than the dictatorship in which he lived began to flood into his head.

There was not much time for Jakl to think or plan; the window of opportunity was only a few days. He knew he needed to act soon, or he would miss his chance to escape. However, he faced a new problem. This type of cargo was different from others. These animals needed supervision and someone to guide them to the chamber. The system assigned a different worker to take the animals from the cowshed to the chamber to ensure their correct transportation.

The problem was that the worker assigned to transport the animals was also responsible for inspecting the chamber and ensuring that no other living creatures besides Merqls were inside before closing it. If any other living creature was found, the alarms would sound and the departure of the chamber would be impeded. Initially, Jakl considered convincing the worker to escape with him, but he realized it was not a good idea. Furthermore, the chamber was scheduled to depart during the day shift, which meant that someone else would be in charge of Jakl's usual tasks.

Despite the social unrest on the planet, there were still many followers of the regime, making it difficult to distinguish between those who were against the system and those who were not. Adding to the challenge, the transport chamber had limited space for only one person. Jakl pondered all possible scenarios that could lead to his freedom, realizing that it would not be an easy feat to accomplish.

# The day

It was still dark outside when Jakl decided to sneak into the chamber and hide in one of the compartments used to store the animal's food. Though an extremely risky idea, it was the only option that countless hours of pondering had brought to his mind. Jakl was not tall, and so could easily fit into the compartment. Additionally, the travel was not going to take too long, making the plan feasible.

The time had come for Jakl to make his move. He only had a few minutes to get from the section he was working into the section where the new chamber was set to depart from. For anyone else, the building might have seemed like a maze, but after years of working there, Jakl was intimately familiar with its complicated corridors. He knew almost instinctively where each aisle led, making it easy for him to navigate through the building.

After several minutes of moving quickly but without arousing suspicion, Jakl arrived at the chamber. He quickly entered some commands on the gate control panel, which he had previously stolen, and a series of sounds indicated that the system was verifying the password. Every second felt longer than the previous one, and the four or five seconds Jakl had to wait for the confirmation of the code seemed like an eternity. Finally, the gate opened, allowing him to enter the chamber and hide in one of the compartments used for storing animal food.

A few seconds after Jakl closed the compartment door, the worker responsible for loading the animals into the chamber arrived. He worked efficiently to ensure the Merqls were securely loaded, as they were known for their docile nature. The task was completed without incident, and the chamber was soon ready for departure to the neighboring planet.

# Arrival

After a few minutes of turbulence, the chamber was now in space. Jakl poked his head in to make sure he was alone. As He had planned, he was completely alone surrounded by a group of animals that were more concerned about the food they were chewing than the curious shape that came out of one of the food compartments. Now Jakl was relatively safe, he only needed to wait about one week to arrive at the neighboring planet. He was excited and nervous at the same time.

Jakl had brought enough food to last a week, just to avoid the pain of starving. He knew the chamber had a special system that provided water to the animals, so he wasn't worried about dehydration. Authorities on both planets had become aware of his presence in the chamber as soon as he left the food compartment, but in space, which is no man's land that didn't matter. The planet he was heading to was prepared for such events; finding people in the cargo of these chambers was a common occurrence. People who were found were treated well and supported to start a new life.

The moment of arrival had arrived, and a red light began flashing, indicating that the chamber was about to enter the planet's atmosphere. Jakl grabbed onto some supports that came into view, not because the turbulence was unbearable, but rather as a natural reaction. Space elevators were a common technology among the planets in that solar system, but the planet Jakl was from only had a few, while the new planet had hundreds of them. Jakl could see them through a small window that allowed him to observe the outside of the chamber. The view was spectacular. He could see how hundreds of space elevators rose from the surface of the planet like long threads, and hundreds of spaceships came and went. The scene resembled a dandelion.
